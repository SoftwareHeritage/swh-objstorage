    """ High-level API to manipulate the Software Heritage object storage.

    Conceptually, the object storage offers the following methods:

    - check_config()  check if the object storage is properly configured
    - __contains__()  check if an object is present, by object id
    - add()           add a new object, returning an object id
    - restore()       same as add() but erase an already existed content
    - get()           retrieve the content of an object, by object id
    - check()         check the integrity of an object, by object id
    - delete()        remove an object

    And some management methods:

    - get_random()    get random object id of existing contents (used for the
                      content integrity checker).

    Some of the methods have available streaming equivalents:

    - add_stream()     same as add() but with a chunked iterator
    - restore_stream() same as add_stream() but erase already existing content
    - get_stream()     same as get() but returns a chunked iterator

    Each implementation of this interface can have a different behavior and
    its own way to store the contents.
